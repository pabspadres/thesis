# Abstract
My thesis, Middleground: The Intersection Between Profitability & Ethics in the Fashion Industry, is an analysis and visualization of data from the fashion industry that poses the question: is there a middle ground where a clothing brand can be ethical and profitable? The project will analyze key subject points such as how a brand is developed, its methods of operations and ethical measures, and what consumers expect from brands ethically. Based on these subject points, I will be analyzing data such as brands’ financial reports, fashion sustainability indexes, and public opinion regarding brands’ ethical measures. With this data, I plan to create visualizations that reflect the perspective of the brand and the customer, to push for better understanding of both sides; the visualizations will include dashboards of real-life consequences of ethical measures put in place and interactive decision-based visualizations that allow the user to test these measures.

The data will be a mix of hand-collected through surveys and interviews, as well as news articles to feed the interactive dashboard, and company reports to assess operational processes of a brand and build the decision-based visualizations. 

The idea for this concept came from three main factors: my interest and professional involvement within the fashion industry, the drastic change in recent years of what is deemed profitable within the industry, and the constant backlash from consumers regarding ethical practices. I believe at this time, what is needed the most when facing this problem is introspection from both the consumer and the brand, so that consumers better appreciate what it means to develop and manage a brand (operations wise); and, so nouveau-entrepreneurs in the industry can learn from consumers’ wants and needs, and find a compromise when building their brand.
